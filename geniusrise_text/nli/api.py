class NLIAPI(TextAPI):
    r"""
    Represents a Natural Language Inference (NLI) API leveraging Hugging Face's transformer models. This class is capable of
    handling various NLI tasks such as entailment, classification, similarity checking, and more. Utilizes CherryPy for exposing
    API endpoints that can be interacted with via standard HTTP requests.

    Attributes:
        model (AutoModelForSequenceClassification): The loaded Hugging Face model for sequence classification tasks.
        tokenizer (AutoTokenizer): The tokenizer corresponding to the model, used for processing input text.

    CLI Usage Example:
    For interacting with the NLI API, you would typically start the server using a command similar to one listed in the provided examples.
    After the server is running, you can use CURL commands to interact with the different endpoints.

    Example:

    ```bash
    genius NLIAPI rise \
        batch \
            --input_folder ./input \
        batch \
            --output_folder ./output \
