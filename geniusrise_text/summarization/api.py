class SummarizationAPI(TextAPI):
    r"""
    A class for serving a Hugging Face-based summarization model. This API provides an interface to
    submit text and receive a summarized version, utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning models for
    text summarization.

    Attributes:
        model (AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM): The loaded Hugging Face model for summarization.
        tokenizer (AutoTokenizer): The tokenizer for preprocessing text.

    Methods:
        summarize(self, **kwargs: Any) -> Dict[str, Any]:
            Summarizes the input text based on the given parameters.

    CLI Usage:

        Summarizes the input text based on the given parameters using a machine learning model. The method
        accepts parameters via a POST request and returns the summarized text.

        Returns:
            Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the input text and its summary.
